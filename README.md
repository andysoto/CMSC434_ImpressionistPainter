Once the app is running, the user can see a variety of buttons: "Download Images", "Load Image", "Brush", "Clear", "Save"
The download image button downloads a set of pictures to the device's gallery. The user can then use the load image to select 
a specific image from the gallery. THe user can then choose from a few brush options: circle, square, line, and an eraser. The 
square brush adjusts its' size depending on the user's velocity when drawing. The circle and line brushes do not depend on velocity. 
The user can click clear to erase the whole painting. Lastly, the user can click save to save the painting to the device's gallery.
